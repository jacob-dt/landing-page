# Landing Page
This is my Landing Page project for The Odin Project Foundations course

### Project Details
The Odin Project provided me with a webpage design that I had to duplicate using only HTML and CSS. I was also given a style guide for fonts and colors. The purpose of this project was to test my knowledge creating a webpage from scratch using flex containers.
